## Introduction
In economics, personal income refers to an individual's total earnings from wages, investment enterprises, and other ventures. It is the sum of all the incomes received by all the individuals or household during a given period. Personal income is that income which is received by the individuals or households in a country during the year from all sources. In general, it refers to all products and money that you receive [1]
## Importance of personal income

National personal income levels are very closely linked to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and they serve as a key indicator on consumer spending, inflationary pressures, the overall economy and markets. 

Income statistics serves as an indictaor of socioeconomic disparities and inequalities that could affect the economy down the road. 

Income statistics also hekps the government on how to give certain benefits with low income earners getting more benefits. For example the last covi-19  stimulus checks sent out by President Biden and the U.S Congress went out to; Single payers who make less than $75000 yearly, heads pof household who makes less than $112,500 yearly and  married couples filing jointly who make less than $150,000 yearly

## Problem statement
Without national ststistics on income , the government will face so many challenges functioning. They need these satistics to know how to distribute benefits to citizens such as pandemic stimulus checks, health care to citizens, housing and other basic living expenses. Having a system that predicts whether a person makes over $50,000yearly gives the government some information or sense of how wealth is distributed in the country and how to sent out benefits to citizens

## Business goal
The goal of this project is to build a system using logistic regression to predict whether a person makes over 50k a year 
## Dataset
This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics). A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1) && (HRSWK>0)) [2]
